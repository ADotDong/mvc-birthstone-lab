### Sinatra Birthstone Lab

The goal of this lab is to create a web application that takes in a user's birth month, and outputs their birthstone. Some of the styling has been done for you, but the rest of the application needs to be created in `model.rb`, `application_controller.rb`, `index.erb`, and `results.erb`.

### Bonus Challenges

**1.** Style the results page so it matches the index.
**2.** Make the results page output a picture and a description of the gemstone in addition to the name of the birthstone
**3.** Create an "About" page with similar styling and link it to the index
**4.** Make your own web application (remember, it must take input and output manipulated data)
